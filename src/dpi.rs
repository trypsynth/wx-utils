//! Converts sizes written in device-independent pixels into the physical pixels wx wants.
//!
//! A Windows app that declares itself per-monitor DPI aware (via an application manifest) is
//! telling Windows it will handle scaling itself: nothing gets stretched for it, and a window
//! asked for 800x600 is 800x600 *physical* pixels. On a 150% display that is 533x400 as far as
//! the user is concerned, so an app that hands wx raw numbers opens two thirds of its intended
//! size.
//!
//! The fix is to write every size as what it should measure at 100% scaling and pass it through
//! here. This is what `wxWindow::FromDIP` does; wxDragon doesn't expose it, so this is the same
//! conversion built on `wxDisplay::GetPPI`, which reports the DPI of the display a given window
//! is actually on rather than one global value - a dialog opened on a second monitor with
//! different scaling gets sized for that monitor.
//!
//! Windows-only by design. macOS and GTK hand wx logical coordinates and do their own scaling,
//! so converting there would apply the scale factor twice; on those platforms these functions
//! return their input unchanged.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use wxdragon::prelude::*;
//! # fn example(dialog: &Dialog) {
//! let list = ListCtrl::builder(dialog)
//!     .with_size(wx_utils::dpi::scale_size(dialog, Size::new(400, 300)))
//!     .build();
//! # }
//! ```
